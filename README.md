# Issue 1287

The project is generated by [LoopBack](http://loopback.io).

Test project for issue 1287 that replicates the problem outlined here: https://github.com/strongloop/loopback/issues/1287

The issue is outlined in the endpoint `GET /MyModels/shouldReturnNumber`. The expected behaviour is that the ids used for the filter should remain numbers after being used in the `find` method.

Here the table:

    CREATE TABLE `my_model` (
    `id` INT(10) UNSIGNED NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
    `name` VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    PRIMARY KEY (`id`)
    )
    ENGINE=InnoDB
    ;
